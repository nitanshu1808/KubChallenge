# Kubicle Coding Challenge

As part of our continuing commitment to the latest cutting-edge data literacy learning solutions and content, Kubicle is working on our first ever robot! Before it will help us with anything to do with our product and technology, weâ€™re going to first program the Robot to clean our new open-plan office in Dublin!

We call it (dramatic pause): OptimusGrime. Your task is to tell OptimusGrime which square-meter of the office that needs to be cleaned by specifying the required coordinates.

In more specific terms, given a grid (where each point on the grid is one square-meter) and a list of points representing square-meters in the office that need to be cleaned, return a list of instructions for getting OptimusGrime to those locations on the grid. An instruction is one of:

> **N**: Move north

> **S**: Move south

> **E**: Move east

> **W**: Move west

> **C**: Clean the square-meter

OptimusGrime always starts at the origin point, (0, 0). As with a mathematical graph, this point lies at the most south-westerly point of the grid. Therefore, given the following input:

```bash
$ ./optimus_grime 5x5 (1, 3) (4, 4ï¼‰
```

one correct solution would be:

> ENNNCEEENC

In other words: move east once and north thrice; clean the square-meter; move east thrice and north once; clean the square-meter.

There are multiple correct ways to navigate between locations. We do not take optimality of route into account when grading: all correct solutions are good solutions.
